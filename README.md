# Adult Income Classification

Capstone project: Prediction of income brackets using machine learning on Adult Census dataset

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50K per year based on census data. The Adult Census Income dataset contains demographic and employment-related features that will be used to train and evaluate classification models.
